# BismuthEngine
Repository for the degree course in Engines, where we will create our own engine from scratch.

Our engine, Bismuth Engine, is a videogame engine made from scratch by two students in the 
UPC degree in Design and Development of Videogames, and more specifically, during the course in 
Game Engines, imparted by **Marc Garrigó Invers** [@markitus18](https://github.com/markitus18)
